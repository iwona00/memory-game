I like programming because there is always something new and interesting to learn about that. It helps me being more patient and hard-working. It's also the best way to develop my logical thinking and creativity. Each task gives me the opportunity to aquire new skills. By resolving problems I have a chance to evolve constantly and it motivates me to be better and better in the future.
